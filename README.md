# Small Ram Air Parachute Design
 
 Code in Matlab to help in the design of ram-air parachutes based on the desired payload, WL (Wing Load) and AR (Aspect Ratio) range, airfoil, equilibrium AOA (Angle of Attack), etc.

 You will find all the theory behind the calculations in my paper (in portuguese): https://bdm.unb.br/bitstream/10483/22626/1/2019_VictorHenriqueCaldeiraBarbosa_tcc.pdf
